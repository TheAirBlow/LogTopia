# Mekanism Culling
**This fix applies for 1.12.2 only! Don't even try to use it on other versions!** \
In short, this makes rendering of Mekanism Generator multiblocks faster, therefore increases FPS. \
You will get less lag when looking at big multiblocks, like 11x18x11 (Industrial Turbine, etc.) \
This mod requires [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter) version `7.1` to modify Mekanism. \
Only Mekanism `9.8.3.390` is supported, don't ask why.

## Before
Invisible faces are rendered, slow

## After
