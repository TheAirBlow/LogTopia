# TekTopia
In short, this disabled all of TekTopia's debug logging, which can get out of hand on servers. \
No more `Removing structure HOME` and similar as `debugOut` was completely patched out to do nothing. \
This mod requires [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter) version `7.1` to modify TekTopia. \
Only TekTopia `1.1.0` is supported, don't ask why.
